# Soul Dew Valley by Joshua Varghese
## IASC 1P04

Soul Dew Valley is a short horror adventure game where players explore an empty haunted house as they piece together the mystery of the main character as a father and his relationship with his daughter, before and after she passed away. Players collect soul dew and channel it to escape all while encountering a monster randomly and must choose to fight it, or follow it. Inspired by *Five Nights at Freddy's*, Sould Dew Valley conveys the idea of facing the ghosts of the past to move on into the future.
